# Todo App

## Idea

If I think of something i want to remember, an idea for example, I should be able to go to todo-app.com, on any machine, and simply add the item as a todo

## Base Features

+ private use website
+ some kind of authorization
+ mobile first
+ task title and optional task description

## Tools

+ flask
+ sqlalchemy
+ a server (hosting?)
+ bootstrap

## Priority list

1. setup database and app logic
2. improve styling if necessary
3. refactor code
4. add new feature

repeat 2 through 4

## Future Features

+ task flags:

    Prioritize, time created, due date?

+ sort list by flags
+ create new lists
+ make deployable for other users

## Thoughts

+ how to host?
+ I want this app to be radically different, just for the sake of creativity
    + unique style?
    + some kind of unique feature?
    + something genius
